On a regular basis I forget to stop my session on my Polar Vantage sportswatch and sometimes I only realize hours later.

Polar Flow let's me correct a limited number of session data (time for one), but it gets unchanged uploaded to my connected Strava account and gives there a wrong image of my efforts.

As we can export the Polar data in tcx format and upload this to Strava, I use this to correct my Strava logs.

1. Download session in Polar flow, exported in tcx format.
2. Upload the file in the Cropping tool
3. Select the right end-point in the displayed heart-rate graph and click-on it.
4. The bottom graph, shows the heart-rate graph for the selected end point.
5. Press the button to download automatically the new tcx-file to your download folder.
6. Go into Strava, delete the automatically synced session (and loose all kudos :-( ) as it will otherwise not accept the new data.
7. Add a 'Manual' entry to Strava from the downloaded file.
