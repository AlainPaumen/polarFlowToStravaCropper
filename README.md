I forget to stop my sportswatch session recording at the end of the session and sometimes hours later I realize it.

I sync my polar account with Strave.  In polarflow I can crop the data in the app, but not really the session (data remains fully intact).

So to correct my Strava account with minimal loss of data, I remove the session in Strava and then upload the corrected session from Polar.

So I select the session in Polar, export the file in tcx format.

Upload this file in the tool, hover with mouse over the graph until I find the correct cutting point, click on it and see my 'cropped' format.

I then download the cropped file from the tool and manually import it into Strava.  Do not forget to delete the original Strava entry before uploading.  It will refuse to accept the new data :-)
